              <p class="card-text"> E-waste contains hazardous materials such as lead, mercury, cadmium, and
                brominated flame retardants. These substances can leach into the environment if not properly
                managed, leading to soil and water contamination. When e-waste is incinerated or left in
                landfills, it can release toxic fumes into the air, posing health risks to nearby communities.

              <p class="card-text">Improper disposal of e-waste has severe environmental consequences. The toxins
                in electronic devices can contaminate soil and water, affecting ecosystems and aquatic life.
                Furthermore, the energy and resources required to manufacture new electronics contribute to
                greenhouse gas emissions and resource depletion. Recycling e-waste helps mitigate these negative
                effects.

                example, can harm the nervous system and cause developmental delays in children. Mercury
                exposure can result in respiratory problems. Proper disposal and recycling of e-waste are

              <p class="card-text"> E-waste recycling involves several stages. First, collected e-waste is sorted
                and dismantled. Valuable materials like gold, silver, and copper are extracted and sent for
                reuse. Hazardous components are safely managed or disposed of. This process conserves resources
                and reduces the environmental impact of mining and manufacturing new electronics.

                locations, or donation options in your area. Remove personal data from devices before disposal.
                Avoid throwing electronics in the trash or shipping them to developing countries, as this
                contributes to the global e-waste problem.
